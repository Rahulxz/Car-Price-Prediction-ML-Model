# Car-Price-Prediction-ML-Model
The project develops a machine learning model to predict car prices using a dataset containing various car attributes. The process involves data loading, EDA, feature engineering (encoding categorical features &amp; binning mileage), &amp; data scaling. A Random Forest Regressor model is trained &amp; evaluated by metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, &amp; R-squared.
